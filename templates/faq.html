    <p>
      what the hek?<br> 
      <strong>a simple messenger service to let u know there's probably a space station overhead</strong><br> 
      why just one state?<br> 
      <strong>baby steps</strong><br> 
      do you take (city/state) requests?<br> 
      <strong>sure! washington.space@gmail.com</strong><br> 
      are there other applications that do this?<br> 
      <strong>yes, and probably much better. But this one has more fun colors</strong><br> 
      how often can I see the ISS over my town?<br> 
      <strong>good question...orbit takes about 92 minutes. But other factors, including planet rotation, daylight, weatherâ€”you'll just have to sign up!</strong><br>
      what should I look for?<br>
      <strong>a small, bright object, moving fast-ish from west to east</strong><br> 
      what is the map for?<br> 
      <strong>the map should show the current (and recent) ISS position/path over north america</strong><br> 
      will you sell my phone number to a hardline regime?<br> 
      <strong>spacewa will never do that</strong><br> 
      why does the space station's apparent path over the earth appear as a sine wave?<br> 
      <strong>this is from the map projection distorting the path (globe flattened out to a map). Maybe also in part due to planet rotation? less sure on that...</strong><br>
      did you copy/paste this code?<br> 
      <strong>yes, but only about 75% of it. For map, see d3.js by M Bostock, very neat</strong><br> 
      shout outs to any API's?<br> 
      <strong>open-notify.org | darksky.net | sunrise-sunset.org</strong><br>
